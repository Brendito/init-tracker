# Combat Tracker 5e

Combat Tracker 5e is a tool for Dungeons and Dragons 5e that helps Game Masters manage tracking health, initiative, players and more during combat.

The tool is written in React and uses Redux for state management.

## Future Plans

This tool is a WIP, there are many features planned. Here are upcoming features, in relatively priority order:

-- Campaign Management (Complete)
-- Combat Tracking (On Hold)
-- Typescript Refactoring (Beginning)
-- Unit Testing
-- Firebase Authentication and Database syncing
-- Alpha Release
-- Spells
-- Campaign Notes

## Development Notes

This is my personal project that I've learnt React and Redux with. This is my second iteration of the app, my first iteration was focused on the combat tracking but managing state became a trouble. I decided to restart and focus on the campaign management first in order to lay the ground work for the combat tracking features later.

At the start of the second iteration, I had a personal battle with myself on whether to begin using Typescript and writing unit tests. What I found was, I was still learning how to properly use React and Redux and was having to refactor code so often that writing unit tests was slowing down my learning process. Not using Typescript from the start has become a big regret, I'm currently beginning the process of refactoring to use Typescript before moving forward with the combat tracking. Maybe I'll write a few unit tests along the way.

This is still very much so a WIP and it's been a long journey. I've grown so much since I started the app that I'm constantly spotting things to refactor and write differently. I can't wait to continue growing and learning better ways to code.
